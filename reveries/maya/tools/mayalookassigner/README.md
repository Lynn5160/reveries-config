# Maya Look Assigner

*Forked from Colorbleed and modified for Reveries*

Tool to assign published lookdev shaders to selected or all matched assets.
Each shader variation is listed based on the unique asset Id of the
selected or all assets.

This *Look Assigner* only looks for lookdev shaders from scene, so they should be loaded by the Loader first, before assigning.

## Dependencies
* Avalon
* `reveries` configuration for Avalon
* Autodesk Maya 2016 and up
