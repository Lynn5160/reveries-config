* Tabs for differ multiple versions
* Scan and add names
* multiple asset/subset comparing
* Full DAG path delegator

1. Select geometries
2. Chose the version to compare
3. Run hash if comparing with scene nodes
4. Generate TODO list or objectSet ?

* After first comparing, generate an objectSet to log the difference
* Rigger working on adopting changes, and remove meshes from that set if done
* Work interrupted, or maybe newer version of model is out
* Rigger compares again, with new version
